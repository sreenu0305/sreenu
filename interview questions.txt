Q : what is the  difference  bw list and tuple
        LIST                                                                                            Tuple
1	Lists are mutable	                                                                       Tuples are immutable
2	Implication of iterations is Time-consuming	                                               The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3	The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.	               Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
4	Lists consume more memory	                                                               Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list
5	Lists have several built-in methods	                                                       Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
6	The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur                                     In tuple,it is hard to take place

Q : difference bitween mutable and immutable
ans: in mutable we can change the internal refference but in immutable we can not change the internal refference

 Q : diff bw append and extend
ans : append is used to add an object at the end of list 
      but extend is used to extebnd the list by appending the elements in the iterable(which have internal refference) 
  
Q : diff bw array and list
ans : List	                                                                  Array
Can consist of elements belonging to different data types	            Only consists of elements belonging to the same data type
No need to explicitly import a module for declaration	                     Need to explicitly import a module for declaration
Cannot directly handle arithmetic operations	                             Can directly handle arithmetic operations
Preferred for shorter sequence of data items	                             Preferred for longer sequence of data items
Greater flexibility allows easy modification (addition, deletion) of data    Less flexibility since addition, deletion has to be done element wise
The entire list can be printed without any explicit looping	             A loop has to be formed to print or access the components of array
Consume larger memory for easy addition of elements                           Comparatively more compact in memory size


Q :  diff bw dict and set
ans : set:
 A set in python is a collection of items just like Lists and Tuples.

A set is created using the set keyword
A set cannot be an element of a set
 
     Dictionary:
A dictionary in python is a collections of key-value pairs of item. For each entry, there are two items: a key and a value. 

keys in a dictionary must be unique
keys are immutable
keys and values can be of any data types
the keys() function returns list of keys in a dictionary
the values() function returns list of values in dictionary


 Q : what are mutable and immutable datatype
Ands :   mutable data types: list,dictionary, set
         immutable data tyupes: tuple,string,frozen set


Q : diff bw index and find
Ans : index = it is used to return of first index of the value 
              and it give  error if object not found 
       find =  it is used to find first index of the value 
                and it will give -1 if it is not found
 

Q :    diff bw partition and split
Ans :   Split :
        1 : Split returns a list
        2 :The size of list returned by a Split functions depends on the seperator and the max split size which is again optional
        3 : Split can work without any arguments, which by default takes spaces and '\n' as default seperator
        Partition : 
        1 : Split returns a tuple
        2 : The size of tuple returned by a partition is fixed and is always 3    
        3 : For Partition an argument is compulsory, else returns an error



 Q  :     why do we preffer dictionary rather than list
 Ans :    we use dictionaries rather than list because dictionary talks about information but list can not talks about information


Q :   which one is faster list or tuple
Ans :  tuple is faste because 
      1: Tuples are stored in a single block of memory. Tuples are immutable so, It doesn't require extra space to store new objects.
      2 : Lists are allocated in two blocks: the fixed one with all the Python object information and a variable sized block for the data.

Q :  which is faster dictionary or list
Ans : dictionary is faster because 
     1 : In Python, the average time complexity of a dictionary key lookup is O(1), since they are implemented as hash tables. The time complexity of lookup in a list is O(n) on average
     2:  The reason is because a dictionary is a lookup, while a list is an iteration, Dictionary uses a hash lookup,
          while your list requires walking through the list until it finds the result from beginning to the result
  
Q :  diff bw set and frozenset
Ans : 1:to create set we use set(),and to create frozenset we use frozenset()
       2: set is mutable and frozenset is immutable
      3 : set and frozenset both objects are hashable but set object is not hashable but frozenset is hashable


Q  : what are various properties of dictionary
Ans : More than one entry per key is not allowed ( no duplicate key is allowed)
      The values in the dictionary can be of any type, while the keys must be immutable like numbers, tuples, or strings.
      Dictionary keys are case sensitive- Same key name but with the different cases are treated as different keys in Python dictionaries.


Q  : what is string,is it mutable or immutable
Ans : A string in Python is a sequence of characters
      string is order sequence and immutable datatype
      if we do operations the origional value doesnot change buty it give dupilicate by applying operation

Q : what is time complexity and how to find it
Ans : Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm
